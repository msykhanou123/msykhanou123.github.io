Everybody Needs Somebody to Love
The Blues Brothers
We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight
And we would especially like to welcome all the
Representatives of Illinois' Law Enforcement Community
Who have chosen to join us here in
The Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time
We do sincerely hope you'll all enjoy the show
And please remember people, that no matter who you are
And what you do to live, thrive and survive
There are still some things that make us all the same
You, me, them, everybody, everybody

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love (someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (sugar to kiss)
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you you you
In the morning
I need you you you
When my soul's on fire
(I need you you you)

Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never never never have a place to hide
I need you

You know people when you do find that somebody
Hold that woman, hold that man
Love him, please him, squeeze her, please her
Hold, squeeze and please that person, give 'em all your love
Signify your feelings with every gentle caress
Because it's so important to have that special somebody
To hold, kiss, miss, squeeze and please
