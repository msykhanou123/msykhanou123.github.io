There's a loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go

You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy
If your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words everyday
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along
You string along

Everyday is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
